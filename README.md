👋 Hi there! I'm an Electrical Engineer with a PhD in the field, and I've been weaving my way through the software world since 2013. My journey began with Fortran 90 during my master's dissertation, shifted to C++ for several years, and then I found my groove with Python in 2019.

📘 I'm a lifelong learner at heart. In 2021, I dove into the deeper waters of software development, exploring the wisdom of Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code" and "Clean Architecture", along with Kent Beck's "Extreme Programming" and Dave Farley's "Modern Software Engineering". These books have been game-changers for me.

🤝 I'm an active member of the Software Crafters Manchester group since 2022. Here, I'm honing my skills in Test-Driven Development, Design Patterns, and Continuous Integration - practices that I now apply daily in my role as a Power Systems Consultant. Since June 2022, I've been the go-to person for software development and data analysis tasks at my company.

👥 Mentoring is my new passion. Starting in 2023, I began guiding my junior colleagues, helping them to enhance their software skills and deepen their understanding of power systems.

🌍 When I'm not coding or consulting, you'll find me hiking the local trails, exploring new countries, or immersed in the world of video games. I believe in living a life full of adventure and continuous learning.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, mentorship, or just a friendly chat about technology and travels!
